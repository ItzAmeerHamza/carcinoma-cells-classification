# carcinoma-cells-classification
A semi supervised learning based approach to classify HES stained histopathological slices. I have compred different state-of-the art models for this classification task. VGG-16 and VGG-19 showed the best results in this task.
<br />
Here are the different classes
Carcinoma neg (-1) --> 0
Carcinoma pos, benign (0) --> 1
Carcinoma pos, malignant (1) --> 2
